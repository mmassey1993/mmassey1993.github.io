<h1 id ="header">About Me</h1>
<h3 id = "subheader">Who I am</h3>
<p id = "paragraph">I am an open, friendly person, with a strong desire to improve my understanding of software development.
    I have always had a keen interest for the Science & Technology industry, which led me on a path to my Geology degree at university.
    During this time, I was more interested in the modules where I used software-based systems to help create something, such as my final year project.</p>
<br>
<h3 id = "subheader">How I got into coding</h3>
    <p id = "paragraph">Upon leaving university, I decided that the IT aspects of my degree were my most enjoyable.
    I then set about learning the basics in various computer languages through an online course with The Training Room, which enabled me to get initial qualifications in HTML5, CSS3, and Java.
    The next step of my development was to be taught the next level in terms of using these, and other, languages, and this led to me joining QA Consulting.
    Since joining QA Consulting, I have learnt about various project methodologies, as well as gone through the basics of SQL and Java SE, before moving on to Java EE and creating an external API.
    This knowledge then helped me complete a group project which involved creating a quiz-style application to help kids become more engaged with computer coding.</p>
